# Modulo-3-Final-Evaluation-Tam-Weibel

## Description

The project involves the development of a web application for searching characters from the world of Harry Potter using the HP-API database. The application structure includes a user-friendly form with a text input and various filters. Results are displayed in a list, with each character represented by a card showing their image, name, and species. Characters without a URL for an image in the API are assigned a default image.

Additionally, users can filter characters by name and house, with 'Gryffindor' set as the default option in the house filter. Leveraging routes and React Router DOM, clicking on a result in the list reveals a more detailed card with an image and additional character information.

## Features

- Character cards displaying image, name, and species.

## Extras
